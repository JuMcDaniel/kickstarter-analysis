# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Technology for analysis

The tools used for this analysis include Excel where pivot tables were used to break down the analysis into failed, successful and canceled kickstarter projects.  I then filtered the data by years and the parent category in order to be easier to see the data presented.  Graphs were then created based on the data within the pivot tables. Conditional statements were also made to color code the data for failed, successful and conceled kickstarter projects to improve ease of viewing in the raw data form.

## Analysis

Purpose of todayâ€™s analysis is to determine the outcomes of Kickstarter funds for the Theater group based on their goal amounts and launch dates. 

Overall, it was determined by the analysis that most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May through June.  Where on the other hand failed campaigns were started in May and October.  The month of May had the highest rate for the initiation of kickstarter campaigns.

The analysis performed on outcomes based on goals it was determined that the less than 1000-dollar goal was the most successful with achieving a 75% success rate.  This is because it is the easiest to achieve because of being the lowest amount.  The second highest percentage of success campaigns was for 35,000 to 45,000 dollars; however, had a much smaller sample size with only 9 projects in total.  The highest fail rate percentage is between 1000-4999 dollars with a sample size of 469 total projects with a failure rate of 73%.  For the amounts of 45,000 and greater have lower rates of success with 45000-49999 dollars at 0% success rate and 50000 dollars or more at 13% success rate.

The biggest difficulty with performing this analysis was formatting the chart with the Theater Outcomes based on Launce date with removing the pivot table filters.  Also performing the Contifs function took some time in order to perform correctly.  I googled the solutions in order to make sure the format is what we would like.
